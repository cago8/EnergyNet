EnergyNet: Energy Trading System Simulation

To practice with the concepts of Java **Collections Framework**, including List, Sets, Maps, Collection class and its methods, and Comparable interface, by simulating a simple energy trading system that operates in a smart grid.

**Overview:**

Energy trading is the buying and selling of energy, traditionally through a centralized market. Smart grids, which are modern energy systems that use digital technologies to monitor, control, and optimize the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity, allow for a more sustainable and efficient use of energy. Consumers are the end-users of energy, while prosumers also produce energy through renewable sources such as solar panels or wind turbines. Prosumers can be consumers when needed. Through energy trading, consumers and prosumers can interact with the grid in a more flexible and efficient manner, reducing waste and supporting the integration of renewable energy sources.
